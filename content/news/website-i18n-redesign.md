# Website Redesigned with Community-Sourced Translations

Please enjoy this delightful new layout. Loris worked hard to
make the website pleasing to the eye on various screen sizes and
color scheme preferences as well as friendlier to programmers with
a wider range of backgrounds.

I watched Loris perform due diligence by carefully choosing which
aspects from established programming language websites to copy, and
which aspects to omit for Zig. But even more importantly,
he actively sought feedback from various Zig communities and made
corresponding adjustments.

The main story here is about internationalization!

## You are Invited to Contribute Translations

Until now, ziglang.org has been accessible only for English speakers. This is
mainly a constraint due to the languages spoken by core team members. But this
website redesign is the beginning of an effort to broaden the audience to
non-English speakers - a small step towards making the entire Zig project
accessible to locales around the world.

Loris optimized the website build process to be friendly towards people contributing
translations. Translations are contributed via pull request; when your pull request
is merged, the website will get auto-deployed. If you are interested in helping with
this process, please see:
